NVA is an institution archive that store metadata and content of many different types and formats. This feature file describes only a part of the total, named NVI.

NVI stands for "Norsk vitenskapsindeks" (Norwegian science index), it is a tentative complete collection of high-quality metadata about academic publications in higher education and research institutions, where authors and institutions of Norwegian concerns are unambiguously connected. 

Academic publication is defined as:
 - present new insight
 - be presented in a form that allows the research findings to be verified and/or used in new research
 - be written in a language and have a distribution that make the publication accessible to the majority of interested researchers
 - appear in an authorised publication channel (journal, series, book publishers, website) that has procedures for external peer review

"Kanalregisteret" (The Norwegian Register for Scientific Journals, Series and Publishers) documents all publications channels. Most channels are unranked, but through a nomination process some are evaluated as low rank scientific (level 1) or high rank scientific (level 2) for academic publishing. The quality evaluation process is NPI – “Norske Publiseringsindikatoren” (Norwegian Publication Indicator) that aims to promote high-quality research and provide an overview of and insight into research activity.

The Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research grants about NOK 700 million every year, that is divided between the NVI institutions, based on their academic publications in ranked channels (level 1 and 2) the previous year. Every publication produces points, and the points are divided following the authors affiliations.

Rules of Author Affiliation:
- The Resource Owner and his Curators can affiliate authors
- Curator can change affiliation on his own authors - on any Resource
  (Note: Main intention is to enable selection of correct subunit at own Institution. The Curator can "give away" the publication to another institution, this is a final action.)

Institutions NVI process
- A Published Resource complying to the rules is a NVI Resource.
- It is marked on the Institution if it is a NVI Institutions.
- Curator can list NVI Resources that is pending for the next NVI-Report.
- The NVI-Report can be filtered on NVI-Status ("Approved" and "Not approved").
- The multi-faceted NVI-Status is defaulted to "Not approved".
- Curator can "Approve" a NVI Resource if the author is affiliated.
- The approval verifies the metadata that makes this Resource a NVI Resource.
- The NVI Resource is "Approved" when all affiliated NVI Institutions have approved it.
- The Approving Curator may send a message to Owning Curator regarding a NVI Resource.

Details of the NVI-Resource, NVI-Report and NVI-Status
- The Resource Owner cannot change a NVI Resource that is partly or fully "Approved".
- If an affiliated Curator judge a NVI Resource to not comply with the rules, then the Resource Owner or his Curator should agree on the metadata or involve the Editors.
- If a NVI Resource is modified so it no longer is a NVI Resource, then a notification is given before the change is performed.
- If a partly approved NVI Resource is modified so it needs new approvals, then a notification is given before the change is performed.
- When a partly approved NVI Resource is modified so it no longer is a NVI Resource, then a notification is sent to all Curator that approved it.
