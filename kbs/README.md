# Clinical Trial

Each year, new participants are recruited to clinical trials
and receive treatment. Eligible trials should report the number
of recruitments every year.

In NVA, we operate with "candidates for Clinical Trial reporting",
which are Projects that may meet the criteria for Clinical Trial
reporting, but are not yet reported. The criteria for candidacy are:

- The Project in NVA must be a Health Project subtype (Drug study
  or Other clinical study)
- The clinical trial that the Project represents must be approved
  by an approvals body (REK or CTIS)
- The Project must be active

The Project Manager of the Project in NVA has final responsibility
to decide whether the Project should be reported, and subsequently
submit relevant data — including number of recruitments and dates
of the first and last recruitment — until the end of the trial.

To assist the Project Manager, Local Project Managers may report
their local recruitment numbers as well.

NVA has an administrative role, "Clinical Trial reporting
administrator", that oversees the yearly reporting process.
It is this role that follows up all reporting and interacts with
Project Managers to ensure data completeness.
At the discretion of the Clinical Trial reporting administrator —
typically when all data for the open period has been reported —
the reporting period is closed and the final report is produced
and uploaded as an NVA dataset asset.
