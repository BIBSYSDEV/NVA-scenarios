# Klinisk behandlingsstudie (KBS)

Each year, new patients are recruited to clinical trials (KBS)
and receive treatment. Annually, these trials should report the
number of new inclusions, until the last new patient is admitted
into the trial.

In NVA context, for a Project to be a candidate for KBS reporting,
a set of requirements must be met. First, it must be approved by
either REK or CTIS. Second, the Project must be active. And third,
the Project must be categorized as a Health Project Type "Other
clinical study" or "Drug study".  
It is ultimately up to the Project Manager to decide whether a
candidate should be marked for KBS reporting, and subsequently
annually report the number of inclusions until the end
of the trial. Furthermore, the date of the first and last
inclusion should be reported when known.

To assist the Project Manager, Local Project Managers may report
their local inclusion numbers as well.

To oversee the reporting process each year, a "KBS Controller"/
"KBS Manager" is assigned to follow up all Project Managers and
make sure all KBS reporting is done.  
When a Controller sees fit, usually when all KBS related Projects
are done reporting, they close reporting for the previous year.
Then, a final report for that year is produced, containing all
reported Projects and their respective inclusion number. This
report is then uploaded to NVA as a dataset.
