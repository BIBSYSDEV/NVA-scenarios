Feature: Health related Project

    In order to do health research a project needs an REK approval
    As a logged in User
    I want to see the current REK approval of my project

    In order to report correctly to HOD about health research project
    As a Anonymus User
    I want to see the Clinical Trial Phase for Drug studies on Landing Page

    Rules:
        - A project with a REK Approval is a Health Project
        - A REK approval originate from REK, through a API call
        - A REK approval containing a ProjectID, update that project
        - A REK approval lacking a ProjectID, originate a new Project
        - Health Projects need an updated REK Approval to change title, coordinating institution, start date, end data or participants of type PRO_MANAGER.

    Questions:
        - Do REK send us changed/updated approvals today?
        - Do a REK approval have a field for our Project ID?
        - How do we cleen up that REK is Project Owner on a lot of projects today?

    Background:
        Given The Project has a Approval of type "REK"
