Feature: User edits Project

    In order to achieve a low mental load on the user
    As Product Owner
    I want the user to experience a high degree of recognition between the desing of Project's registration wizard and Publication’s registration wizard

    In order to manage a Project's content
    As a User
    I want to be able to manage all possible information about the Project in one place

    In most cases the Project Manager reside from the Coordinating Institution
    Vocabulary warning: Most funding organizations use the term "project" to describe (one of possible many) funding sources a project may have.

    Rule: A project can only have one Project Owner, Project Manager and Coordinating Institution - at any given time

    Rule: A project may have several sources of funding. Warning: Funding organizations consider their funding to be a project and/or a grant, but from our point of view - it's only a part of the projects total funding.
