Feature: User edits Project

    In order to achieve a low mental load on the user
    As Product Owner
    I want the user to experience a high degree of recognition between the desing of Project's registration wizard and Publicationâ€™s registration wizard

    In order to manage a Project's content
    As a User
    I want to be able to manage all possible information about the Project in one place

    In most cases the Project Manager reside from the Coordinating Institution
    Vocabulary warning: Most funding organizations use the term "project" to describe (one of possible many) funding sources a project may have.
