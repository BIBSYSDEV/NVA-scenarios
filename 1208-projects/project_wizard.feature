Feature: User edits Project

    In order to manage a projects content
    I want to be able to manage all relevant information

    In order to achive a low mental load on the user
    I want to achive a high degree of recognition between the desing of Projects registration wizard and Publications registration wizard

    Background: 
        Given A User is logged in with relevant access
        # The User has a role defined in the project 
        # or is a Curator for one of the defined users

    Rule: Any User can create a project, becoming origin Project Owner
