The Editor is the main custodian of the business aspects of the Institutional repository. The Administrator is their technical counterpart. 
An Institution must have both roles assigned to be operational.

Any editor is the Editor
The Editor may grant the Editor role to other Users, at the same Institution. There is no built-in support for sharing responsibibility between Editors. The Editors decide how many Curators the Institution needs.

Editor is the teamlead of the Curators
A Curator's default responsibility is all Users at the Institution, but the Editor may narrow it to any formal part of the Institusion and thus reduce the group of Users this Curator is responsible for. Any unresolved conflicts or requests from own Users, or conflicts involving Users from other Institutions, might be an Editor's task. It is advised that the Editor User is also assigned the Curator role.

How many Editors and Curators?
Smaller Institutions may deem one User to be both the Editor and the Curator. A larger institution may need a handful of Curators. A large Institution may deem it necessary to define each second-to-top level Curator an Editor and each Editor may have several Curators. Some reasearch teams may create enoungh work to need their own Curators.

Use of Vocabularies
Some Institutions wish to arrange resources into classes or categories according to shared qualities or characteristics. To accommodate this goal, the Editor may decide which vocabularies the Users may use in the Registration Wizard. Vocabularies are field-/domain-specific, so Institutions with a strong field focus may wish all Users to use the same vocabulary. Others may offer the User a selection of optional vocabularies.

Publishing permissions
The Editor defines the Institutions publication policy and can choose one of the three options:
	Registrator has full publishing rights
	Registrator can only publish metadata
	Only Curator can publish
See publishings_rights.feature for details.
